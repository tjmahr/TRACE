# TRACE

This repository contains source code for the word recognition model 
TRACE (McClelland & Elman, 1986). 

The purpose of this repository is not to provide functioning software, but 
to collect source code that is of scientific and historical interest. 
Moreover, this repository can help authors port TRACE to other languages by 
providing definitive answers to fine implementation details.

Over the years, I have found two different archives with the source code 
online. Both are contained here. I labeled them based on the email address 
domains used in the README files.

## cmu

* Downloaded from Jay McClelland's PDP lab page: 
<https://web.stanford.edu/group/pdplab/resources.html>. 
* The file-modified dates are circa September 1992.
* I lightly modified some comments in the code to make some phoneme definitions 
more explicit. (See commit history). 
* Unedited files are in the compressed 
archive file `cmu_trace.tar.gz`. 

## ucsd

* Downloaded from a repository by Jeff Elman: <ftp://crl.ucsd.edu/pub/neuralnets/>. 
* The file-modified dates are circa January 1988.
