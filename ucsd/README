TRACE tape
==========

The top-level directory contains a Makefile plus .c and .h files
needed to compile trace.  After the tape contents are loaded onto
disk you should be able to say "make trace" and all the compiles and
loading will be done automatically.  If you say "make trace >& errs"
and are running under the CSH the compile errors will be collected
and diverted to file "errs"; you can mail this to me if there are
serious problems.

If you are not running under Unix and/or do not have the "make" program 
you can compile by giving the command:
     cc -o trace trace.c initialize.c interact.c command.c pwt.c util1.c util2.c util3.c fetvals.c -lm

(the -lm loads in the math library; with some non-Unix C compilers this is not
necessary).  This will compile all the .c modules, link them together, 
and put the executable on a file called "trace"


The following sudirectories are also present on the tape.

	i/		sample input files;  these contain
			3 numbers per line: phoneme - rate - duration
	l/		sample lexicons;  one word per line.  Each
			word may optionally have a word frequency
			on the same line; if you use freq. you must
			set the wfreq constant to a non-0 value.
	s/		sample scripts; with these you can say
				% trace < s/script 
			and have all the trace commands read in 
			automatically 
	p/		parameter files.

Input, lexicon, and parameter files can either be read in while in
trace (with the "in", "lex", or "param" commands), or specified on
the command line, e.g., "trace -l l/phonolex -p p/p1 -i i/kargo";
blanks are necessary between arguments.
